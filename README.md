## [Overview]()

A complete educational implementation of a Natural Language Processing (NLP) pipeline for social media sentiment classification. This project illustrates how computers convert human language into structured numerical representations, learn linguistic patterns, and predict emotional tone in text data.

The notebook presents an end-to-end NLP workflow, guiding the reader from raw text preprocessing to model training and evaluation. It demonstrates how unstructured language is transformed into machine-readable features and how a machine learning model leverages those features to classify sentiment accurately.

The project covers both foundational and advanced NLP concepts, including vector mathematics, cosine similarity, word embeddings, Bag-of-Words vectorization, and transformer-based contextual embeddings with BERT. Each stage is implemented with educational clarity, connecting theory to practical application.

The architecture mirrors real-world NLP systems used in sentiment analysis, social media monitoring, customer feedback analytics, and intelligent automation solutions.

The repository is structured as a progressive learning journey — beginning with mathematical fundamentals and culminating in a fully functional sentiment classification model for social media text.

## 1. [What Is This Notebook About ?]()

This notebook is like a **recipe book** for teaching computers how to understand what people write or say. It shows step-by-step how to take words, turn them into numbers, teach a computer about them, and then let it guess if a message is, for example, happy or sad!


<br><br>

## 2. [Playing With Numbers (Vectors)]()

<br>

- [**Why ?**]() Numbers help computers see words!

- [**What is it ?**]() We make some number sequences called *vectors*. Then, we add, subtract, multiply and compare them. This is the building block for more magic later.

- [**Code:**]()

<br>

```python
import numpy as np
vetor1 = np.array([1., 2., 1., 4.])
vetor2 = np.zeros(4)
vetor3 = np.ones(4)
print("Vetor 1", vetor1)
print("Vetor 2", vetor2)
print("Vetor 3", vetor3)
print("Add", vetor1 + vetor3)
print("Subtract", vetor1 - vetor3)
print("Multiply", vetor1 * vetor3)
print("Dot Product", np.dot(vetor1, vetor3))
```


<br><br>

## 3. [Finding Out If Two Things Are Alike (Cosine Similarity)]()

<br>

- [**Why ?**]() To see if two words or sentences are "friends"—meaning they’re similar.

- [**What is it ?**]() We use special math called *cosine similarity* to compare.

- [**Code:**]()

<br>

```python
from numpy.linalg import norm
A = np.array()[^1][^2][^3]
B = np.array()[^2][^3][^1]
cos_sim = A @ B / (norm(A) * norm(B))
print("Cosine Similarity (Math)", cos_sim)


from sklearn.metrics.pairwise import cosine_similarity
print("Cosine Similarity (Library)", cosine_similarity([A], [B]))
```

<br><br>



## 4. [Using Secret Codes For Words (Word Embeddings)]()

<br>

- [**Why ?**]() Computers need numbers for everything. Embeddings are like secret codes for words—each word gets its own code!

- [**What is it ?**]() We use special files or libraries to get these codes and can ask things like “who is most similar to king,” or do word puzzles.

- [**Code:**]()

<br>

```python
!pip install safetensors gensim
from safetensors.torch import load_file


# Loads word codes


tensors = load_file('embeddings.safetensors')
vectors = tensors['embeddings']  \# torch.Tensor
print(vectors.shape)


from gensim.models import KeyedVectors
word2vec = KeyedVectors.load_word2vec_format('cbows50.txt')
word_vec = word2vec['computer']
print("Code for computer:", word_vec)


import gensim.downloader
print("Models we can use:", list(gensim.downloader.info()['models'].keys()))
word2vec = gensim.downloader.load('glove-twitter-50')
print("Are man and boy similar?", word2vec.similarity('man', 'boy'))
print("Who is like computer?", word2vec.most_similar('computer', topn=5))
print("Who’s the queen puzzle answer?", word2vec.most_similar(positive=['king', 'woman'], negative=['man'], topn=1))
```

<br><br>

## 5. [Super-Secret Codes: Transformers and BERT]()

<br>

- [**Why ?**]() Sometimes the meaning of a word changes depending on the sentence. These super-secret codes work like magic—they change if the word is used differently!

- [**What is it ?**]() We use *transformers*, like BERT, to get codes (embeddings) for each word in its special context.

- [**Code:**]()

<br>

```python
!pip install transformers
import torch
from transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModel
device = 'cpu'
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained('neuralmind/bert-large-portuguese-cased', do_lower_case=False)
bert = AutoModel.from_pretrained('neuralmind/bert-large-portuguese-cased').to(device)


texto = "Eu vou ao banco pagar a conta hoje."
input_ids = tokenizer.encode(texto, return_tensors='pt')
wordpieces = tokenizer.convert_ids_to_tokens(input_ids)
subwords_idx = [i for i, wordpiece in enumerate(wordpieces) if not wordpiece.startswith("\#\#")]
input_ids = input_ids.to(device)
with torch.no_grad():
outs = bert(input_ids)
vetores = outs[0, subwords_idx]
print("Codes for each word:", vetores)
```

<br><br>


## 6. [Getting Our Messages (Loading Data)]()

<br>

- [**Why ?**]() We need messages to play with!

- [**What is it ?**]() We get tweets from a file and see what kinds of feelings they talk about.
 
- [**Code:**]()

<br>

```python
import pandas as pd
df = pd.read_csv("TweetsMg.csv")
print("Columns:", df.columns)
print("How many of each feeling:", df['Classificacao'].value_counts())
print("First few messages:", df['Text'][:5])

```

<br><br>

## 7. [Cleaning Up Our Messages (Text Preprocessing)]()

<br>

- [**Why ?**]() Some words (like “the”, “and”, “a”) don’t help. We clean them out so the computer doesn’t get confused.

- [**What is it ?**]() We use lists of *stopwords* to throw away those boring words.

- [**Code:**]()

<br>

```python
import nltk
nltk.download('stopwords')
stopwords = nltk.corpus.stopwords.words("portuguese")
```

<br><br>


## 8. [Turning Words Into Numbers (Bag of Words)]()

<br>

- [**Why ?**]() Computers can only understand numbers!

- [**What is it ?**]() We use CountVectorizer to make a table where each word becomes a column and each message gets number values in those columns.

- [**Code:**]()

<br>

```python
from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import CountVectorizer
vectorizer = CountVectorizer(stop_words=stopwords)
vetores = vectorizer.fit_transform(df['Text'])
vocab = vectorizer.get_feature_names_out()
import pandas as pd
pd.DataFrame(vetores.toarray(), columns=vocab).head(5).to_excel("encoding.xlsx")
```


<br><br>


## 9. [Splitting Our Messages (Training and Testing)]()

<br>

- [**Why ?**]() So we can teach the computer with some messages and test it with others!

- [**What is it ?**]() We change feelings from words (“happy”, “sad”) to numbers and split the messages.

- [**Code:**]()

<br>

```python
X = vetores
y, label = pd.factorize(df['Classificacao'])
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)
```

<br><br>


## 10. [Teaching Our Computer To Guess Feelings (Model Training)]()

<br>

- [**Why ?**]() This is where we actually TEACH the computer!

- [**What is it ?**]() We use Naive Bayes—a special recipe that learns from examples.

- [**Code:**]()

<br>

```python
from sklearn.naive_bayes import MultinomialNB
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score
clf = MultinomialNB()
clf.fit(X_train, y_train)
y_pred = clf.predict(X_test)
accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)
print("Accuracy", accuracy)
```

<br><br>

## 11. [Saving Our Computer’s Brain For Later (Model Persistence)]()

<br>

- [**Why ?**]() After teaching, we save the computer’s knowledge to use anytime.

- [**What is it ?**]() We use a tool called pickle to remember what the computer learned.

- [**Code:**]()

<br>

```python
import pickle
with open("model.pkl", "wb") as f:
pickle.dump(clf, f)
model_persisted = pickle.load(open("model.pkl", "rb"))
y_pred2 = model_persisted.predict(X_test)
accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred2)
print("Accuracy", accuracy)
```

<br><br>


## 12. [Asking The Computer To Guess For Us! (Interactive Prediction)]()

<br>

- [**Why ?**]() Now you can type any message and let the computer guess the feeling!

- [**What is it ?**]() You type, it predicts using everything it learned.

- [**Code:**]()

<br>

```python
novotexto = input("Type a message: ")
novotextovetorizado = vectorizer.transform([novotexto])
previsao = clf.predict(novotextovetorizado)
label_pred = previsao
print(label_pred)
```
